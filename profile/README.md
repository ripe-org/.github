## 🍊 Ripe
Here at Ripe, we have been creating open sourced software since **August 1st, 2022**. 

### 🗨️ Communication
As of right now we are using [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ripe-org/discussions) since this allows for all communication to be both handled by all our team and easily accessed to anyone using our software. All posts such as update information, safety announcements, or any recent news about our repositorys will be uploaded to that section. You can also post discussions located within categories like `📣 Announcements`, `💬 General` and `🙏 Q&A` providing information for all.

### 🦑 Contributing
Ways of contributing the the community are as listed:
